<h2>The Main Contenders</h2>
<hr />

<h2>Attack On Titan The Final Season: Part 2</h2>

<p>This movie was the most epic and dark conclusion to the <br/>
most epic anime of all time! Full of twists and turns and insane<br/>
action, this conclusion was well worth the wait!</p>

<h2>Super Mario Bros Movie</h2>
<p>This is very much a biased view as this is only warranted for<br/>
those who are avid fans of the super mario bros video <br/>
game franchise! Full of easter eggs and a very feel-good watch<br/>
for the whole family. </p>

<h2>Saw X</h2>
<p>To some this may be a hot take, but Saw X was one of the best <br/>
entries in the franchise! A refreshing take on the series and <br/>
the return of Tobin Bell makes this horror experience a must-see!</p>
